# hangman.py
A simple hangman game.

This game uses a small dictionary "smalldic.txt" and randomly selects a word for the user to guess within a limited number of guesses. (Guesses allowed depends on the length of the word).

This is a simple game but it was enjoyable to create and I have fun playing it.
